# Core Concepts

## The Big Picture

Gamegine wraps the complexity of FRC simulation into four main components:

1. **Representation**: Nouns. (Robots, Field, Gamepieces).
2.  **Simulation**: Verbs. (Moving, Scoring, Colliding).
3.  **Analysis**: Brains. (Pathfinding, Trajectories).
4.  **Rendering**: Eyes. (Visualizing the state).

## The Variable System

Gamegine uses a reactive variable system (`ValueEntry`) to track state changes. This allows for:
- Automatic logging of all changes.
- "Time-travel" debugging (replay).
- Reactive UI updates.

## NCIM (Units)

All measurements in Gamegine use NCIM. You never pass raw floats.

```python
from gamegine.utils.NCIM.ncim import Meter, Degree, Second

distance = Meter(5)
angle = Degree(90)
speed = distance / Second(2)
```
