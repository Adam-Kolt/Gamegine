# Analysis Tools

Gamegine provides powerful tools to analyze the game field and generate optimal paths.

## Pathfinding

We use A* search on a generated navigation mesh.
- **VisibilityGraph**: Connects visible points.
- **TriangulatedGraph**: Meshes the free space.

## Trajectory Generation

Generates smooth, physics-constrained paths for swerve drives.
- **Sleipnir**: The underlying optimizer.
- **Constraints**: Velocity, acceleration, and centripetal force limits.
