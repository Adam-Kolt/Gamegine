# Getting Started with Gamegine

## Installation

Gamegine requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
pip install gamegine
```

## Your First Simulation

To create a basic simulation, you'll need to define a `Game` and a `Robot`.

```python
from gamegine import Game, SwerveRobot
from gamegine.render import Renderer

# 1. Create a Game
game = Game("My First Spec")

# 2. Add a Robot
robot = SwerveRobot("HeroBot")
game.add_robot(robot)

# 3. Visualize
renderer = Renderer.create(game)
renderer.run()
```

## Next Steps

- Explore [Core Concepts](./core-concepts) to understand the architecture.
- Dive into [Simulation](./simulation) to learn about physics and rules.
