# Rendering System

Gamegine uses `arcade` for high-performance 2D rendering.

## The Renderer

The `Renderer` class is a singleton that manages the window and drawing loop.

### Layers

Objects are drawn on layers (z-order):
- `floor` (Field image)
- `ground_markings` (Tape lines)
- `objects` (Robots, Gamepieces)
- `ui` (Overlays)

## Custom Rendering

You can register custom render handlers for your own objects using decorators.

```python
@Renderer.on_draw(MyCustomObject)
def draw_my_object(obj, canvas, theme, **kwargs):
    # Draw code here
    pass
```
