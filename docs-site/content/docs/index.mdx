# The Gamegine Philosophy

Gamegine is more than just a robotics simulation library; it is a **comprehensive framework for modeling competitive reality**. Born from the rigorous demands of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), it bridges the gap between theoretical strategy and physical execution.

## Simulation as Validity

In competitive robotics, a strategy is only as good as its execution. Gamegine operates on the principle that **accurate simulation is the highest form of validation**. By modeling the physical constraints, robot kinematic limits, and game logic with high fidelity, we transform "what if" into "what will be".

> "The map is not the territory, but a good map tells you where the cliffs are."

## Core Principles

### 1. Deterministic Physics
We believe in reproducible results. Gamegine's physics engine is designed to be deterministic, ensuring that a strategy that works once works every time under the same conditions. This reliability is crucial for autonomous path planning and strategy refinement.

### 2. Composition over Inheritance
Robots are complex systems composed of distinct subsystems. Gamegine mirrors this reality. A `SwerveRobot` isn't just a subclass; it's a composition of a drivetrain, kinematics model, and control system. This allows for modularity and easy reconfiguration.

### 3. Visual Introspection
Data without visualization is noise. Gamegine prioritizes **rich, real-time visualization**. Whether it's the `Renderer` displaying a live match or the debugging tools showing pathfinding nodes, we ensure you can always *see* what your code is thinking.

### 4. Unit Safety
Physical units are first-class citizens. Using our **NCIM (New Compact International Measurements)** system, Gamegine enforces dimensional correctness at the type level. Feet don't accidentally become meters. Torque doesn't become Force. This eliminating an entire class of common engineering errors.

## The Architecture

Gamegine is built on four pillars:

1.  **Representation**: defining the world (Games, Obstacles, Robots).
2.  **Simulation**: The core loop that advances state and enforces rules.
3.  **Analysis**: Tools for pathfinding, trajectory generation, and strategy optimization.
4.  **rendering**: The visual layer that brings the simulation to life.

## Why Gamegine?

Because winning matches starts weeks before the robot hits the field. It starts here, in the simulation, where iterate is cheap and perfection is attainable.

Welcome to the future of FRC strategy.
