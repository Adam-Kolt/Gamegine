# gamegine.representation.gamepiece

## Classes

### Gamepiece

```python
class Gamepiece
```

Abstract class which holds structure for representing a gamepiece, consisting of a name, bounds, and physical properties.

#### `display`

```python
def display(x: gamegine.utils.NCIM.Dimensions.spatial.SpatialMeasurement, y: gamegine.utils.NCIM.Dimensions.spatial.SpatialMeasurement, render_scale: gamegine.utils.NCIM.Dimensions.spatial.SpatialMeasurement)
```

Abstract method for displaying a gamepiece on the field screen.

:param x: The x-coordinate of the gamepiece.
:type x: :class:`SpatialMeasurement`
:param y: The y-coordinate of the gamepiece.
:type y: :class:`SpatialMeasurement`
:param render_scale: The scale at which the gamepiece should be rendered.
:type render_scale: :class:`SpatialMeasurement`

### GamepiecePhysicalProperties

```python
class GamepiecePhysicalProperties
```

Stores the physical properties of a gamepiece, including mass and friction coefficient.

#### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, mass: gamegine.utils.NCIM.Dimensions.mass.MassMeasurement, friction_coefficient: float) -> None
```

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
