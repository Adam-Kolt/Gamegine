# gamegine.simulation.logic

## Classes

### LogicRule

```python
class LogicRule
```

Represents a logic rule that triggers an action based on a condition.

:param name: Unique name of the rule.
:param condition: A function that takes GameState and returns True/False.
:param trigger_type: How the rule fires (ON_TRUE or WHILE_TRUE).
:param action: A ValueChange or a callable returning a list of ValueChanges.
:param delay: Time in seconds the condition must be true before firing.
:param interval: (For WHILE_TRUE) Minimum time between firings. currently unused but good for future.

#### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, name: str, condition: Callable[[gamegine.simulation.game.GameState], bool], trigger_type: gamegine.simulation.logic.TriggerType, action: Union[gamegine.simulation.state.ValueChange, List[gamegine.simulation.state.ValueChange], Callable[[], List[gamegine.simulation.state.ValueChange]]], delay: float = 0.0, interval: float = 0.0)
```

Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.

#### `update`

```python
def update(self, dt: float, game_state: gamegine.simulation.game.GameState) -> List[gamegine.simulation.state.ValueChange]
```

Updates the rule state and returns any triggered changes.

### TriggerType

```python
class TriggerType
```

Create a collection of name/value pairs.

Example enumeration:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class Color(Enum):
...     RED = 1
...     BLUE = 2
...     GREEN = 3

Access them by:

- attribute access:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Color.RED
  &lt;Color.RED: 1&gt;

- value lookup:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Color(1)
  &lt;Color.RED: 1&gt;

- name lookup:

  &gt;&gt;&gt; Color['RED']
  &lt;Color.RED: 1&gt;

Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

&gt;&gt;&gt; len(Color)
3

&gt;&gt;&gt; list(Color)
[&lt;Color.RED: 1&gt;, &lt;Color.BLUE: 2&gt;, &lt;Color.GREEN: 3&gt;]

Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
attributes -- see the documentation for details.
