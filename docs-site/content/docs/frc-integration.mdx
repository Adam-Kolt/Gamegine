# FRC Integration

Gamegine is designed to work *alongside* your robot code, not just replace it.

## Exporting Paths

You can export generated trajectories to formats compatible with:
- PathPlanner
- Choreo
- Custom CSV/JSON formats

## WPILib Compatibility

Helper functions are provided to convert Gamegine `SpatialMeasurement`s to WPILib Geometry classes (`Translation2d`, `Pose2d`).
