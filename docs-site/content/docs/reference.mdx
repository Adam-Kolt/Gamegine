title: Reference Data
description: Vendor measurements and drivetrain constants packaged with Gamegine.
---

The reference package collects the physical constants and vendor measurements used by the
planning tools. Values are expressed using the NCIM unit system so they can be combined
without extra conversions.

```python title="motor_lookup.py"
from gamegine.reference.motors import KrakenX60

print(KrakenX60.free_speed)
```

Docstrings in each reference module clarify what unit a quantity is expressed in and how it
maps to the optimiser constraint fields (e.g. torque limits feeding into
`SwerveModuleConstraints`).

## Motors

`gamegine.reference.motors` stores motor definitions and helper utilities for calculating
speed/torque trade-offs.

## Gear trains

`gamegine.reference.gearing` enumerates common gear reductions and module stages used in
swerve drivetrains.

## Swerve drivetrains

`gamegine.reference.swerve` and `gamegine.reference.wheels` hold measured dimensions for
popular swerve modules and wheel packages.

## Modules

- `gamegine.reference.motors`
- `gamegine.reference.gearing`
- `gamegine.reference.swerve`
- `gamegine.reference.wheels`
