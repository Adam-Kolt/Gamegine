# Simulation Engine

The simulation engine is the heart of Gamegine. It ticks continuously, updating the state of the world.

## Physics vs Logic

Gamegine separates **Physics** (movement, collision) from **Logic** (scoring, rules).

### PhysicsEngine
Handles:
- Rigid body dynamics (simplified).
- Collision detection.
- Trajectory execution.

### MatchController
Handles:
- Game rules.
- Scoring.
- Autonomous/Teleop periods.
