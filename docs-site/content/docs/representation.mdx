title: Field Representation
description: Model the field, obstacles, interactables, and robots.
---

The representation package captures the physical layout of the field, including the walls,
obstacles, scoring locations, and robots that inhabit it. These models feed both the
renderer and the analysis/trajectory modules.

## Games and zones

`gamegine.representation.game.Game` is the main container for a field. It tracks the field
size, static obstacles, interactables, and optional border padding that keeps robots within
bounds. Use helper methods such as `add_obstacle` and `enable_field_border_obstacles` to
assemble a playable environment.

```python title="game_setup.py"
from gamegine.representation.game import Game
from gamegine.representation.obstacle import Rectangular
from gamegine.utils.NCIM.ncim import Meter

game = Game("Practice Field")
game.set_field_size(Meter(15), Meter(8))
game.add_obstacle(Rectangular("Stage", Meter(2), Meter(3), Meter(3), Meter(1)))
game.enable_field_border_obstacles()
```

## Bounds and obstacles

Geometric primitives live in `gamegine.representation.bounds`. `Boundary` is the abstract
base class, while `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Polygon` implement concrete shapes along with
conversion helpers such as `DiscreteBoundary.discretized`. The
`gamegine.representation.obstacle` module wraps these boundaries into named `Obstacle`
instances that can be attached to a `Game`. `ExpandedObjectBounds` and related utilities are
frequently used when expanding obstacles by the robot footprint before meshing. Each
boundary now carries docstrings covering the available transformations (`translate`,
`scale`, `reflect_x`, `reflect_y`) so it is easier to pipeline CAD-derived shapes without
losing track of units.

## Interactables and other field elements

Robot actions are modelled with `RobotInteractable` instances, providing interaction options
that affect game state. The `gamepiece` and `apriltag` modules expose additional convenience
classes covering common field features for FRC-style games. Each interactable exposes a
navigation point and a set of :class:`gamegine.representation.interactable.InteractionOption`
objects—check the inline docstrings for guidance on when to use `ableToInteract` and how to
describe state transitions.

## Robot representation

`gamegine.representation.robot` records the drivetrain geometry and module properties required
by trajectory generation, including module spacing, mass properties, and swerve
characterisation helpers. The module level docstrings explain how the NCIM quantities map to
`SwerveRobotConstraints`, making it easier to feed the optimiser realistic limits.
